Project Url:  [The Loomis Agency](http://theloomisagency.com)  
A portfolio website for a scrappy marketing agency built with Ruby on Rails and RefineryCMS.  For this project I was flying solo, doing full stack development while managing the project timeline.

At this point I had spend nearly my entire web development career on the front end, and I welcomed the chance to build a project from soup to nuts.  The decision to go with Rails was purely pragmatic:  There were people around the office with Rails experience in case I found myself stuck.  Our choice of hosting platform, Heroku, dictated which version control system we were to use and, though I had little or no experience with these specific tools, my prior experience with python and mercurial came in handy;  Mercruial being a distributed vcs and Django being a MVC based web framework.
